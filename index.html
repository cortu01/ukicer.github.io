<p class="lead">
The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference from the UK ACM Special Interest Group in
Computing Science Education is going online!
</p>
<p>
While we will miss meeting physically in person, we looking forward to welcoming many more to our community, both nationally and internationally,
with reduced registration fees and interactive online sessions. The approach also allows us to simplify and extend deadline dates and provide more time to authors as booking accommodation and travel are no longer a constraint.
The abstract deadline is Friday the <b>3rd of July 2020</b> with full paper expected the following week on <b>Friday the 10th of July 2020</b>.

<a href="files/callforpapers.pdf">Call for Participation (PDF).</a>
</p>

<p class="lead">

</p>


<h3>Papers</h3>
<p>
  We invite submissions of research papers on the topic of computing education. Themes of interest include:
<ul>
  <li>Computing education pedagogy</li>
  <li>Assessing and providing feedback on computing assignments</li>
  <li>Issues of inclusivity and diversity</li>
  <li>Tools to aid computing education</li>
  <li>Computing education issues particularly relevant to a British and/or Irish context</li>
</ul>
  All submissions related to computing education are welcome, at any stage of formal education (or outside formal education).
</p>
<p>
Papers should describe a rigorously executed piece of work, include a motivating research question and discussion of prior related work. We welcome:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Research papers</b> describing a research experiment in a school, university or informal educational setting. The experiment should be rigorously conducted â€“ if this is the case, null results will still be considered for publication.</li>
  <li><b>Tool design papers</b> which carefully document design constraints, user considerations, relevant pedagogical concerns, and justify the design decisions taken in a way that would be useful to other designers, and include details of user testing or other initial measures of effectiveness.</li>

<!--
  <li><b>Discipline specific scholarship reports</b> cemented in relevant research and with thorough analysis of practice and critical reflection on the teaching and learning of students.</li>
  <li><b>Industry experience reports</b> that reflect on delivery of industry linked, professional-level or work-based learning programmes.</li>
-->

</ul>
<p>
All submitted papers should have a research component. Papers focused purely on practice-related topics such as implementation of new curricula or new course designs may be better suited to our sister <a href="http://community.dur.ac.uk/cep.conference/2019/index.php">Computing Education Practice</a> conference.
</p>

<!--
          <h4>Paper Format and Submission</h4>
          <p>Papers should be submitted in <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM double-column conference proceedings format</a>.
            The <b>page limit is six pages</b>, not counting the references. The references may occupy a seventh page if the paper reaches the six-page limit. Papers must be submitted in an anonymised form for double-blind review. Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings, and presented in a session at the conference.</p>
-->

<h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>
We invite proposals for running 1 to 2-hour workshops. The workshops should be relevant to British and Irish educators (in a university or school setting) and/or computing education researchers. Example workshops may be on the use of research techniques (e.g. qualitative methods), grant writing, pedagogical techniques (e.g. peer instruction), tools (e.g. programming environments, assessment tools), or any other topic which may be relevant to conference attendees.
</p>
<p>
Workshops will take place in the afternoon of first day of the conference. Workshop organisers will be given an opportunity to advertise their workshop via a one-minute lightning talk earlier in the conference.

          </p>

          <p>Workshop proposals should consist of a max 500 word abstract, which should include: details of the workshopâ€™s content, practical requirements (e.g. group discussion tables, computer room, etc) whether or not this workshop has been run before, and intended take-away knowledge for participants.</p>


          <h3>Review process and publication</h3>
          <p>
          The review process is double-blind with authors required to submit anonymised artefacts.
          Each submission is reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee.
          Upon completion of reviews, reviewers enter the discussion stage and are expected to discuss their reviews anonymously, especially when notable differences exist.
          The programme chair utilises discussions and reviews to determine an appropriate balance of accepted papers.
        </p>

          <h3>Accepted submissions</h3>
          <p>
            If accepted, authors must submit camera-ready source files through the ACM Production System (TAPS).
            The camera-ready submission must include author details, affiliations and any relevant information previously removed for the purposes of review.
          </p>

          <p>Authors are required to complete an electronic <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-and-license-forms">ACM e-Rights Transfer Application</a> and include the appropriate ACM Right Statement and bibliographic strip in the camera-ready submission.</p>

          <p>The camera-ready submission must also include and display the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) index terms, as designated by the authors. The interactive <a href="https://dl.acm.org/ccs">ACM CCS tool</a> can be used to generate the appropriate code block.</p>

          <p>
          Authors that have questions or have encountered difficulties with the ACM authoring templates should contact the Aptara support team (<a href="mailto:acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com">acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
          The final submission will be published in the conference proceedings. At least one author must register for the conference and present the accepted paper for it to appear in the conference proceedings. All accepted submissions must be presented at the conference by a subset of the authors.
          </p>
          <h3>Publication of proceedings</h3>
          <p>
The official publication date of the conference proceedings is when they become available via the digital repository. The specific date may be up to 14 days prior to the initial day of the conference. Contributors should be aware of this publication date when considering other artefacts associated with published work, e.g. patent filings.
          </p>

          <h3>Previous proceedings</h3>
          <p>The proceedings from the conference last year are available on the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3351287">ACM Digital Library</a></p>
