<h1>Welcome to UKICER 2021</h1>

<p class="lead">
The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference from the UK ACM Special Interest Group in
Computing Science Education Chapter is emerging as one of the leading venues nationally and internationally for researchers and
practitioners to meet and share advances in computing science education.
</p>

<p>
The UKICER 2021 theme is <b>learning together</b> and has been chosen to emphasise that (1) computing science education researchers can learn from one another and
and from (2) researchers in other disciplines such as mathematics, physics and art.
</p>

<p>
We are a diverse and inclusive community bringing together researchers, academics, industry practitioners and teachers
from across the United Kingdom and Ireland as well as from the rest of Europe and the wider world.
</p>

<p>
The conference takes place on <b>Thursday 2nd of September 2021</b> and <b>Friday 3rd of September 2021</b>.</p>
</p>

<h2>Online conference</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference from the UK ACM Special Interest Group in Computing Science Education will be online!</p>

<p>While we will miss meeting physically in person, we looking forward to welcoming many more to our community, both nationally and internationally, with reduced registration fees and interactive online sessions. The approach also allows us to simplify and extend deadline dates and provide more time to authors as booking accommodation and travel are no longer a constraint. The abstract deadline is <b>Friday the 2nd of July 2021</b> with full papers expected the following week on <b>Friday the 9th of July 2021</b>.</p>

        <h1>Call for Participation</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference from the UK ACM Special Interest Group in Computing Science Education Chapter is seeking high quality contributions to research relevant to computing science education.
</p>
<p>
          Contributions are sought in a variety of categories with emphasis on high-quality and rigorous work.
          Researchers have the opportunity to disseminate their work as a full paper, workshop or poster.
        </p>


        <h2>Papers</h2>
<p>
We invite submissions of research papers on the topic of computing science education. Themes of interest include:
<ul>
<li>Computing science education pedagogy</li>
<li>Assessing and providing feedback on computing assignments</li>
<li>Issues of inclusivity and diversity</li>
<li>Tools to aid computing science education</li>
<li>Computing science education issues particularly relevant to a British and/or Irish context</li>
</ul>
All submissions related to computing science education are welcome, at any stage of formal education (or outside formal education).
</p>
<p>
Papers should describe a rigorously executed piece of work, include a motivating research question and discussion of prior related work. We welcome:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Research papers</b> describing a research experiment in a school, university or informal educational setting. The experiment should be rigorously conducted – if this is the case, null results will still be considered for publication.</li><br/>
<li><b>Tool design papers</b> which carefully document design constraints, user considerations, relevant pedagogical concerns, and justify the design decisions taken in a way that would be useful to other designers, and include details of user testing or other initial measures of effectiveness.</li>

<!--
<li><b>Discipline specific scholarship reports</b> cemented in relevant research and with thorough analysis of practice and critical reflection on the teaching and learning of students.</li>
<li><b>Industry experience reports</b> that reflect on delivery of industry linked, professional-level or work-based learning programmes.</li>
-->

</ul>
<p>
All submitted papers should have a research component. Papers focused purely on practice-related topics such as implementation of new curricula or new course designs may be better suited to our sister <a href="http://community.dur.ac.uk/cep.conference/2019/index.php">Computing Education Practice</a> conference.
</p>


        <h4>Paper Format and Submission</h4>
        <p>Papers should be submitted in <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM double-column conference proceedings format</a>.
          The <b>page limit is six pages</b>, not counting the references. The references may occupy a seventh page if the paper reaches the six-page limit. Papers must be submitted in an anonymised form for double-blind review. Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings, and presented in a session at the conference.</p>


<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>We invite proposals for running 1-2 hour workshops. The workshops should be relevant to British and Irish educators (in a university or school setting) and/or computing science education researchers. Example workshops may be on the use of research techniques (e.g. qualitative methods), grant writing, pedagogical techniques (e.g. peer instruction), tools (e.g. programming environments, assessment tools), or any other topic which may be relevant to conference attendees.</p>
<p><!--Workshops will take place in the afternoon of first day of the conference.--> Workshop organisers will be given an opportunity to advertise their workshop via a one-minute lightning talk earlier in the conference.</p>





<h2>Posters</h2>
<p>We invite posters for presentation and discussion at the conference. The posters should be relevant to British and Irish educators (in a university or school setting) and/or computing science education researchers. Example posters could include initial ideas, experimental designs, pedagogical techniques or early proposals to address open challenges in computing science education research.</p>

<h2><a id="rippa">Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs)</a></h2>
<p>
Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs) are a new form of collaborative, community-forming activity for Computing Science education research and practice at the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
</p>
<p>
The aim is to bring practitioners and researchers together in computing science education to form networks, exchanges ideas, form collaborations and put research into practice, incorporate research into practice or improving practice.
</p>
<p>
RIPPAs span several months and participants are expected to commit to participating in a small number of workshops asÓ well as conducting some activity in their context, such as incorporating research into practice, collecting data and/or conducting research.
</p>
<h3>Participation and Commitment</h3>
<p>
The specific participation and commitment requirements depends on the RIPPA, but broadly RIPPAS required participants to:
</p>

<ul>
  <lI><b>Join information hour.</b> Prospective <i>rippers</i> should join one of several information hours to find out about the specific RIPPA and what it involves. Ask questions and meet others interested in the activity.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Attend start-up workshop.</b> The workshop will introduce the RIPPA, methodologies and approaches utilised as well as provide an opportunity for participants to get to know each other and learn about what is happening across the community.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Perform activity.</b> Rippers are expected to perform some activity as part of the project. This activity could be to conduct research in their own context, incorporate research into their own practice or improve their practice. Rippers would then share their contributes back to the group remotely.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Attend interim workshop.</b> The workshop will give participants an opportunity to share their contributions as well as analyse results and discuss any insights from the activity. The group will then begin to form it into a complete outcome and decide next steps.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Capstone workshop.</b> The final workshop to pull together together any remaining work involved in the activity and form into an artefact that can be disseminated among the community through the optimal channel, such as the Computing Education Practice (CEP) or United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Relax and unwind at a wrap-up dinner.</b> Wrap-up meal and opportunity to reflect on the experience and plan future collaborations with other rippers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>
  The focus of RIPPAs is the participants and the expectation is that <i>rippers</i> will achieve the following from participating in a RIPPA:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Strengthened knowledge and skills in research and practice.</b>
    Dependent on the specific RIPPA, the expectation is that participants will strengthen their knowledge and skills. This could be awareness emerging teaching practice and how to investigate it, appropriate methodologies for computing education research (CER) and/or deepened appreciation of the state of the art in CER.
    </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Strengthened and expanded network of collaborators.</b>
    Form connections with academics, scholars and researchers from across the computing science education community with similar interests and challenges.
    Valuable not only for conducting future research investigations but also to gain insight into innovative practice in other institutions as well as creating bonds with other academics to discuss on-going sector challenges and how to solve them.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
<b>Publication.</b>
The expectation is that outcomes of RIPPAs will be high-quality, multi-institutional studies that are authentic and steeped in data from contexts spanning many different from many perspectives.
Participants will be authors on such high-quality contributions that are difficult to devise and coordinate for most sole academics.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>RIPPA 2021: Spatial Skills</h2>

<p>
The RIPPA 2021 aims to find out whether a) first-year students with better spatial skills have better programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method), b) whether spatial skills change over a period of computing instruction and c) what demographic data contribute towards high spatial ability. Future goals of the project will be to investigate whether improving first-year students’ spatial skills improves their programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method).

      The proxy chair assembles an expert panel of two or more members, the members are not required to be part of the programme committee.
      The members of the expert panel are not known to the chairs.
      The proxy chair and expert panel consider the conflicted papers, reviews and any discussion amongst reviewers.
      The expert panel makes the final decision on the conflicted papers and this is communicated to the conference chairs.
