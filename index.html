        <h1>Call for Participation</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference from the UK ACM Special Interest Group in Computing Science Education is seeking high quality contributions to research relevant to computing science education.
</p>
<p>
          Contributions are sought in a variety of categories with emphasis on high-quality and rigorous work.
          Researchers have the opportunity to disseminate their work as a full paper, workshop or poster.
        </p>


        <h2>Papers</h2>
<p>
We invite submissions of research papers on the topic of computing education. Themes of interest include:
<ul>
<li>Computing education pedagogy</li>
<li>Assessing and providing feedback on computing assignments</li>
<li>Issues of inclusivity and diversity</li>
<li>Tools to aid computing education</li>
<li>Computing education issues particularly relevant to a British and/or Irish context</li>
</ul>
All submissions related to computing education are welcome, at any stage of formal education (or outside formal education).
</p>
<p>
Papers should describe a rigorously executed piece of work, include a motivating research question and discussion of prior related work. We welcome:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Research papers</b> describing a research experiment in a school, university or informal educational setting. The experiment should be rigorously conducted â€“ if this is the case, null results will still be considered for publication.</li>
<li><b>Tool design papers</b> which carefully document design constraints, user considerations, relevant pedagogical concerns, and justify the design decisions taken in a way that would be useful to other designers, and include details of user testing or other initial measures of effectiveness.</li>

<!--
<li><b>Discipline specific scholarship reports</b> cemented in relevant research and with thorough analysis of practice and critical reflection on the teaching and learning of students.</li>
<li><b>Industry experience reports</b> that reflect on delivery of industry linked, professional-level or work-based learning programmes.</li>
-->

</ul>
<p>
All submitted papers should have a research component. Papers focused purely on practice-related topics such as implementation of new curricula or new course designs may be better suited to our sister <a href="http://community.dur.ac.uk/cep.conference/2019/index.php">Computing Education Practice</a> conference.
</p>

<!--
        <h4>Paper Format and Submission</h4>
        <p>Papers should be submitted in <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM double-column conference proceedings format</a>.
          The <b>page limit is six pages</b>, not counting the references. The references may occupy a seventh page if the paper reaches the six-page limit. Papers must be submitted in an anonymised form for double-blind review. Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings, and presented in a session at the conference.</p>
-->

<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>We invite proposals for running 1-2 hour workshops. The workshops should be relevant to British and Irish educators (in a university or school setting) and/or computing education researchers. Example workshops may be on the use of research techniques (e.g. qualitative methods), grant writing, pedagogical techniques (e.g. peer instruction), tools (e.g. programming environments, assessment tools), or any other topic which may be relevant to conference attendees.</p>
<p>Workshops will take place in the afternoon of first day of the conference. Workshop organisers will be given an opportunity to advertise their workshop via a one-minute lightning talk earlier in the conference.</p>





<h2>Posters</h2>
<p>We invite posters for presentation and discussion at the conference. The posters should be relevant to British and Irish educators (in a university or school setting) and/or computing education researchers. Example posters could include initial ideas, experimental designs, pedagogical techniques or early proposals to address open challenges in computing science education research.</p>

        <h2><a id="review">Review process</a></h2>
        <p>
        The review process is double-blind with authors required to submit anonymised artefacts.
        Each submission is reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee.
        Upon completion of reviews, reviewers enter the discussion stage and are expected to discuss their reviews anonymously, especially when notable differences exist.
        The programme chair utilises discussions and reviews to determine an appropriate balance of accepted papers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#conflict">Conflict of Interest.</a> Reviewers are required to declare any conflicts of interest in advance of reviewing papers.</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#proxy">Proxy chair and expert panel.</a> Submissions that represent a conflict of interest for any of the chairs are passed to the proxy chair and panel for initial consideration.</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#accepted">Accepted submissions.</a> At least one author for accepted submissions is required to register for the conference.</p></li>
      </ul>


      <h3><a id="conflict">Conflict of Interest</a></h3>
      <p>
      Authors must ensure their submissions abide by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">ACM Conflict of Interest Policy (COI)</a>.
      Reviewers are required by chairs to identify any conflicts of interest prior to being allocated any submissions to review.
      Authors are expected to inform any conflicts of interest prior or at the point of submission of any artefacts for review.
      </p>

      <h3><a id="proxy">Proxy chair and expert panel</a></h3>
      <p>
      Submissions that represent a conflict of interest for all conference chairs are passed to the proxy chair.
      The proxy chair assembles an expert panel of two or more members, the members are not required to be part of the programme committee.
      The members of the expert panel are not known to the chairs.
      The proxy chair and expert panel consider the conflicted papers, reviews and any discussion amongst reviewers.
      The expert panel makes the final decision on the conflicted papers and this is communicated to the conference chairs.
      </p>

        <h3><a id="accepted">Accepted submissions</a></h3>
        <p>
          If accepted, authors must submit camera-ready source files through the ACM Production System (TAPS).
          The camera-ready submission must include author details, affiliations and any relevant information previously removed for the purposes of review.
