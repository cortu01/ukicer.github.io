                        The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference from the UK ACM Special Interest Group in Computing Science Education Chapter is emerging as one of the leading venues nationally and internationally for researchers and practitioners
                        to meet and share advances in computing science education.
                    </p>

                    <!--
<p>
The UKICER 2021 theme is <b>learning together</b> and has been chosen to emphasise that (1) computing science education researchers can learn from one another and
and from (2) researchers in other disciplines such as mathematics, physics and art.
</p>
-->
                    <p>
                        We are a diverse and inclusive community bringing together researchers, academics, industry practitioners and teachers from across the United Kingdom and Ireland as well as from the rest of Europe and the wider world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The conference takes place <b>in-person</b> on <b>Thursday 7th of September 2023</b> and <b>Friday 8th of September 2023</b> in Swansea, Wales.</p>

<h2>Online conference</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference from the UK ACM Special Interest Group in Computing Science Education will be online!</p>

<p>While we will miss meeting physically in person, we looking forward to welcoming many more to our community, both nationally and internationally, with reduced registration fees and interactive online sessions. The approach also allows us to simplify and extend deadline dates and provide more time to authors as booking accommodation and travel are no longer a constraint. The abstract deadline is <b>Friday the 2nd of July 2021</b> with full papers expected the following week on <b>Friday the 9th of July 2021</b>.</p>

                        <h3>Keynote Abstract</h3>
                        <p>The ultimate goal of any research relating to education is to make a difference, either directly or indirectly, to the learning experience. Educational research can generate reliable and valid answers to well-defined questions, providing evidence to inform changes to policy or practice. Educational research in the domain of computer science is no exception.
                            <br>
 <br>

Computer science education research (CSER) is a unique field in many ways. Unlike mathematics and science education research it has made its home in university computer science departments (rather than in faculties of education), and for decades it primarily focused on university-level teaching and learning. Higher education teaching practice is necessarily localised and the impact of some CSER has been arguably very local too, driven by excitement rather than educators’ familiarity with pedagogy. In recent years we’ve seen the growth of CSER focusing on school education alongside the introduction of computing into many countries' curricula around the world; with the lack of an established knowledge base on the teaching and assessment of computing we have the opportunity and responsibility to make our research as impactful as possible.
<br>
 <br>

 In this UKICER keynote I will be examining the topic of the impact of research with specific reference to computer science education research, through both a discussion of knowledge mobilisation and also highlighting practical suggestions for researchers. I hope through this keynote to promote conversation around the ways in which we can all focus on impact in CSER and look forward to many stimulating discussions during the conference.</p>

                    <h1>RIPPA:Designing and Assessing Authentic Software Development Projects in Undergraduate Computing Education</h1>
                    <p>Team software development projects are a crucial component of undergraduate computing education. Studies of software developers in industry underscore the need for undergraduates to acquire authentic software development experiences in which they contribute to legacy code bases within collaborative software development contexts. Despite their clear educational value, team software development projects are notoriously challenging to implement and assess. Drawing on experience and relevant research results, this Research in Practice Project Activity (RIPPA) brings together computing educators and researchers to discuss, research, and innovate approaches to designing and assessing authentic software development projects. Participants are invited to run empirical studies in their own courses in which they (a) collect subjective and objective measures of team and individual progress in software projects, and (b) explore alternative pedagogical and assessment approaches, including those supported by the use of custom learning management and data analytics tools. By the end of the RIPPA, we aim to publish one or more research papers that advance the state-of-the-art in team software project pedagogy, supporting technology, and assessment based on the results of multi-institutional research studies.</p>

                    <h5>Friday 2nd September, 13:30 to 15:00</h5>
                    <p>Are you interested or involved in any gender balance activities or any initiatives targeting people from underrepresented groups? E.g. events to encourage women and girls to study computing or student networking events.<br><br>We've been working on gender balance projects and also investigating ways to improve their efficacy and we'd like to share this with you and provide an opportunity for you to share what you've been doing. Participants with no experience are also welcome. We'll introduce 3 of the projects we've been working on: <a href="https://ada.scot/"> Ada Scotland Festival</a>, <a href="https://ada.scot/women-in-tech/"> Women into Tech</a>, and <a href="https://ada.scot/role-models/"> Gender Imbalance in Digital Technology</a>. Then we'll share our <a href="https://ada.scot/participant-centred-planning-framework/"> Participant-Centred Planning Framework</a> and look at tips for maximum impact and associated challenges together. <br><br>Finally we'll all share ideas for in-situ evaluation methods and ideally test them out. </p>

                    <h2><a id="rippa">Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs)</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs) are a new form of collaborative, community-forming activity for Computing Science education research and practice at the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aim is to bring practitioners and researchers together in computing science education to form networks, exchanges ideas, form collaborations and put research into practice, incorporate research into practice or improving practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RIPPAs span several months and participants are expected to commit to participating in a small number of workshops asÓ well as conducting some activity in their context, such as incorporating research into practice, collecting data and/or conducting research.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Participation and Commitment</h3>
                    <p>
                        The specific participation and commitment requirements depends on the RIPPA, but broadly RIPPAS required participants to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <lI><b>Join information hour.</b> Prospective <i>rippers</i> should join one of several information hours to find out about the specific RIPPA and what it involves. Ask questions and meet others interested in the activity.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Attend start-up workshop.</b> The workshop will introduce the RIPPA, methodologies and approaches utilised as well as provide an opportunity for participants to get to know each other and learn about what is happening across
                            the community.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Perform activity.</b> Rippers are expected to perform some activity as part of the project. This activity could be to conduct research in their own context, incorporate research into their own practice or improve their practice.
                            Rippers would then share their contributes back to the group remotely.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Attend interim workshop.</b> The workshop will give participants an opportunity to share their contributions as well as analyse results and discuss any insights from the activity. The group will then begin to form it into a
                            complete outcome and decide next steps.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Capstone workshop.</b> The final workshop to pull together together any remaining work involved in the activity and form into an artefact that can be disseminated among the community through the optimal channel, such as the
                            Computing Education Practice (CEP) or United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Relax and unwind at a wrap-up dinner.</b> Wrap-up meal and opportunity to reflect on the experience and plan future collaborations with other rippers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The focus of RIPPAs is the participants and the expectation is that <i>rippers</i> will achieve the following from participating in a RIPPA:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Strengthened knowledge and skills in research and practice.</b> Dependent on the specific RIPPA, the expectation is that participants will strengthen their knowledge and skills. This could be awareness emerging teaching practice
                            and how to investigate it, appropriate methodologies for computing education research (CER) and/or deepened appreciation of the state of the art in CER.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Strengthened and expanded network of collaborators.</b> Form connections with academics, scholars and researchers from across the computing science education community with similar interests and challenges. Valuable not only
                            for conducting future research investigations but also to gain insight into innovative practice in other institutions as well as creating bonds with other academics to discuss on-going sector challenges and how to solve them.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Publication.</b> The expectation is that outcomes of RIPPAs will be high-quality, multi-institutional studies that are authentic and steeped in data from contexts spanning many different from many perspectives. Participants
                            will be authors on such high-quality contributions that are difficult to devise and coordinate for most sole academics.

<h2>RIPPA 2021: Spatial Skills</h2>

<p>
The RIPPA 2021 aims to find out whether a) first-year students with better spatial skills have better programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method), b) whether spatial skills change over a period of computing instruction and c) what demographic data contribute towards high spatial ability. Future goals of the project will be to investigate whether improving first-year students’ spatial skills improves their programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method).

                    <h3>Process for Papers and Posters</h3>
                    <p>
                        The review process for papers and posters is double-blind with authors required to submit anonymised artefacts. Each submission is reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee. Upon completion of reviews, reviewers enter the discussion
                        stage and are expected to discuss their reviews anonymously, especially when notable differences exist. The programme chair utilises discussions and reviews to determine an appropriate balance of accepted papers.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#conflict">Conflict of Interest.</a> Reviewers are required to declare any conflicts of interest in advance of reviewing papers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#proxy">Proxy chair and expert panel.</a> Submissions that represent a conflict of interest for any of the chairs are passed to the proxy chair and panel for initial consideration.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p><a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#accepted">Accepted submissions.</a> Authors must prepare accepted submissions for publication and at least one author is required to register and attend the conference.</p>

                    </ul>


                    <h4><a id="conflict">Conflict of Interest</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        Authors must ensure their submissions abide by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">ACM Conflict of Interest Policy (COI)</a>. Reviewers are required by chairs to identify any conflicts of
                        interest prior to being allocated any submissions to review. Authors are expected to inform any conflicts of interest prior or at the point of submission of any artefacts for review.
                    </p>

                    <h4><a id="proxy">Proxy chair and expert panel</a></h4>
                    <p>
                        Submissions that represent a conflict of interest for all conference chairs are passed to the proxy chair. The proxy chair assembles an expert panel of two or more members, the members are not required to be part of the programme committee. The members
                        of the expert panel are not known to the chairs. The proxy chair and expert panel consider the conflicted papers, reviews and any discussion amongst reviewers. The expert panel makes the final decision on the conflicted papers
                        and this is communicated to the conference chairs.
                    </p>

                 <p>A vibrant Computer Science Education (CSE) Community of Practice is emerging in the UK and Ireland (UK&I), promoted by national and international professional body/learned society specialist interest groups and supported through a number of CSE research and practice conferences. This workshop explores how this community of practice addresses the needs of new computer science academics to UK&I higher education and what opportunities there are to bring together and develop new academics as a part of this community. The complex and contesting demands of teaching, research and managing (courses and modules) in UK&I higher education make the early career of an academic challenging and potentially lonely. Typically, initial mentoring of early career academics is via the host Department providing support for working towards a Fellowship of Higher Education Academy.
At this workshop attendees will participate in a qualitative research exercise and develop a proposal to further promote the value of early career academics engaging with CSE research to enhance and develop their own research activities. In particular, addressing:
<ol>
<li>What current and future opportunities are there to establish a national mentorship scheme for early career academics. What format would such a scheme take and how can it be used to facilitate the development of CSE research. </li>
<li>How can the subject community establish, develop and support a buddying scheme for early career academics. How can such a network be developed to stimulate the growth of CSE research. </li>
<li>How can we continue to raise the profile of early career academics engaging in CSE research?</li>
</ol> </p>

                 <p>My experience shows me that students fear team assessments in general, and that this is even more common in computing science due to our longer term, or year-long student group projects. Staff also discuss these issues too. We can borrow ideas from the software development industry, and other professions to guide us towards solutions.
This workshop builds on previous ones done with MSc IT students as they prepare for the term-long group project as the final part of their degree, and aims to provide participants an experiential opportunity to explore the concerns their students have raised to see if collectively they might co-create solutions with fellow participants. Afterwards they can use the handouts and experience to guide their implementation of the workshop with their students.</p>

                 <h6>Do we belong? An innovation workshop for fostering a sense of belonging in Computer Science education.</h6>

                 Kelly Widdicks, <em>Lancaster University</em>.<br/>

                 Lynne Blair, <em>Lancaster University</em>.<br/>
                 <br/>
<p>Only 18% of Computer Science (CS) undergraduate students in 2018 were women ; academia and apprenticeships are also seeing fewer and fewer women choosing to pursue CS. This failure to engage women in CS education and training is recognised at a career-level too, with women comprising only 16% of UK IT professionals. Following this, efforts have been made to encourage women in the field, including initiatives that celebrate women in CS, and inclusive CS education principles such as EngageCSEdu. UK universities and academic institutions have also set gender equality commitments through the Athena Swan Charter, aiming to create inclusive environments for all students and staff. However, women are still under-represented in the sector, and prior work has shown that a main reason for this is that women do not feel a sense of belonging in CS. Through this workshop, we aim to build upon a focus group structure designed to uncover reasons for not belonging, and ideate solutions to overcome this, to create a collaborative space at UKICER 2021 where experts and professionals can reflect on their own experiences of belonging and their knowledge of CS education. By doing this, we aim to co-design solutions with the community that will help foster all students' belonging, regardless of their gender identity or membership of any underrepresented group. We also aim to gain participants' feedback and insights for future iterations of the innovative focus groups that can be utilised and applied for other underrepresented groups and in other institutions, departments or settings.

                 <h6>Hermeneutic phenomenology for computing education research</h6>

                 <br/>
                 <p>There are many different approaches to qualitative research which can be used in empirical studies, but often in computing education research we do not specify exactly the approach we are using. A phenomenological approach, which can be descriptive or hermeneu- tic (interpretive), involves investigating the ’lived experience’ of research participants. It relates to the whole research process, not just to how we analyse data. Hermeneutic phenomenology is one approach that has been widely used in some fields, for example, in nursing research and general education, but is rarely, if at all, used in computing education research. As research within computing education may benefit from hermeneutic phenomenology, the pur- pose of this workshop is to introduce this methodology and offer participants some first-hand experience of approaching a study through a phenomenological lens.</p>

                 <h6>Measuring the Difference Between Student and Staff Perception of Self-Efficacy and Confidence Using Online Tools</h6>

                 <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shift in how we teach, how students learn, but has also drawn attention to the inequalities of pedagogy [1]. These inequalities have exacerbated the already known issues relating to student’s self-efficacy, metacognition and confidence [2]. We present a workshop designed to discuss best practice in relation to online learning, with discussions about its capacity to promote self-regulated learning and improve student confidence in their technical skills [3]. The workshop will present a tool which addresses some of the barriers and difficulties students may encounter when learning AI [4]. We then ask participants for their thoughts on improving student self-efficacy and inclusive learning. Participants will leave the workshop with a greater under- standing of these concepts and best practice they can implement within their own teaching.</p>
