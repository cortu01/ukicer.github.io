<h2>Research in Practice Project Activites (RIPPAs)</h2>
<p>
Research in Practice Project Activites (RIPPAs) are a new form of collaborative, community-forming activity for Computing Science education research and practice
at the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research conference.
The aim is to bring researchers, scholars and practioners together in computing science education to form networks, exchanges ideas, form collobrations and put research into practice.
</p>

<h3>Participation and Commitment</h3>
<ul>
  <lI><b>Join an information Hour.</b> Prospective <i>rippers</i> should join one of three information hours to find out about the RIPPA and what it involves. Ask questions and meet others interested in the activity.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Start-up workshop.</b> The workshop will introduce the RIPPA, methodolgies and approaches utilised as well as provide an opportunity for participants to get know each other and learn about what is happening across the community.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Putting research into practice.</b> Rippers will conduct research inline with the RIPPA in their own context and then share contributes back to the group remotely.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Interim workshop.</b> The workshop will give participants an opportunity to share their contributions, analyse results and discuss any insights. The group will then begin to form it into a complete outcome and decide next steps.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Capstone workshop.</b> The final workshop to pull together to pull together any remaining work and form into a contribution for dissemination to the community either at conference or in journal.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Wrap-up dinner.</b> Wrap-up meal and oppurunity to reflect on the experience and plan future collaborations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcomes from Participation</h3>
<p>
The expectation is that RIPPAs will have the following outcomes for researchers, scholars and practitioners that participate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Strengthen knowledge and skills in research and practice.</b>
    The expectation is that participates will strengthen their knowledge of appropriate research methodologies
    for computing science education research, appreciate for state of the art practice and how to investigate it.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Expand and strengthen network of collaborators.</b>
    Form connections with academics, scholars and researchers from across the computing science education community with similar interests and challenges.
    Valuable not only for conducting future research investigations but also to gain insight into practice in other insitutions and their solutions for on-going challenges.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
<b>Disseminate research and practice in respected venue.</b>
The expectation is that outcomes of RIPPAs will be high-quality, multi-insitutional studies that are authentic and steeped in data from contexts spanning many different from many perspectives.
Participants will be authors on such high-quality contributions that are difficult to devise and coordinate for most academics.

</ul>



<h3>How does it fit in your context?</h3>

<h3>RIPPA 2021</h3>

<p> Jack's study: Yes. It's a simple set of interventions that is clearly under the control of the teacher and doesn't affect anything else in the course. I think you should require at least grades (demographics desirable, but more tricky - would depend on carefully constructed ethical approval) as that is the buy-in/pay-off for the participants: a) they get to see if the correlation "works" in their context and b) the get to see if/how it "works" in other contexts, and so get clues as to in what direction they might move their practice. Making it a two-year study, with the intervention in the second year is strong, I think.

These need to be elaborated!  We can say much more about the precise detail - Jack has written a whole proposal / outline of how it will work.</p>

  Glad you think this one is a fit.  Agreed - anyone can do it (who has access to a first year programming course).  Requiring additional diagnostics would be good.  It would also be really helpful to know about prior programming experience - notoriously difficult to capture well, I have found.  At least, separating “no programming experience” from others would be good.  A survey would be better than a test, really - easy to administer, less threatening.  Do you know of any good ones?  I find so many that folk come up with seem highly flawed.  (It’s unclear to me how reliable FCS/SCS are…)

  OK there's an issue here that's common across all this kind of work, and which you have to face every time. Although there has to be a purpose for the _content_ of the study, and it has to be "real" and convincing and appealing, the _activity_ is centrally NOT about the leader. The most important people in the room are the participants and you have to structure the project entirely around them. So suggesting a project that only rewards Ethel, where the participants have to do "almost nothing" simply won't work. There's no purpose to engagement, no gain, no reward for them; they're just "subjects".

  Here's how we expressed it in terms of running a Commons:

  You are not there to be an expert in the disciplinary area ...
  This can be difficult. As educators we are very used to being
  the content expert, to being the person at the front of the room
  doing the talking. But it is vital to the success of the endeavour
  that you abrogate this role. It is especially important—even if
  asked—that you DO NOT contribute your own experience; as the
  leader, you carry authority and if you start saying “Well, what we
  do at Poppleton is ...” then participants will listen to you, and both
  their own work and that of the collective will suffer.

  You would have to shape Ethel's study better to be suitable for a RIPPA - I'm happy to talk/help think about what that might mean.

  And, in regard to instantiating RIPPA as a model, I wonder if we need to think about a "leadership" in a more subtle way. These are tricky to organise. Maybe we should think about developing a pool of people who can advise/shepherd structure? Perhaps we might require every project to involve a leader who does not "own" the work?

 1.  What is this activity addressing?
More focussed that “general area”, this would be interpreted as “what is your research question” in a paper/thesis context. Being specific allows potential participants a clear view of what it is about (also has the useful benefit of focussing the mind of the project proposer :)
In Jack’s case I guess it would be something like “This RIPPA aims to find out whether a) first-year students with better spatial skills have better programming skills (regardless of teaching environment/method) and b) whether improving first-year students’ spatial skills improves their programming skills (regardless of teaching environment/method)”

2. Existing work
An outline of what has been done, that this study will build on, and which suggests it might produce useful knowledge (in a paper/thesis context “literature review”. Gives confidence that the proposers know what they are doing). In Jack’s case, I would guess, an outline of the positive results at Glasgow.

3. What does participation involve?
I think I’d tend to be relatively high-level here – what module do you have to be teaching, how many meetings will be required, how many interventions (and of what type – quizzes, tests etc.), what data is wanted (e.g. demographics/grades – will you need them to get ethical approval?), what sort of analysis (qual/quant/mixed). Plenty of time for nitty-gritty details when they’ve signed up.
I’d include a timeline here  too - always good to see a calendar laid out.

4. (Possibly) expected outcomes

I like the “early meeting” – I think it would be good to include that in all of these. A no-obligation invitation “If you want to find out more, come to the open meeting on <date>, or if you have particular questions contact <person>”
