  <h2>Research in Practice Project Activites (RIPPAs)</h2>
  <p>
  Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs) are a new form of collaborative, community-forming activity for Computing Science education research and practice at the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
  </p>
  <p>
  The aim is to bring practitioners and researchers together in computing science education to form networks, exchanges ideas, form collaborations and put research into practice, incorporate research into practice or improving practice.
  </p>
  <p>
  RIPPAs span several months and participants are expected to commit to participating in a small number of workshops as well as conducting some activity in their context, such as incorporating research into practice, collecting data and/or conducting research.
  </p>
  <h3>Participation and Commitment</h3>
  <p>
  The specific participation and commitment requirements depends on the RIPPA, but broadly RIPPAS required participants to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <lI><b>Join information hour.</b> Prospective <i>rippers</i> should join one of several information hours to find out about the specific RIPPA and what it involves. Ask questions and meet others interested in the activity.</li>
  <br>
    <li><b>Attend start-up workshop.</b> The workshop will introduce the RIPPA, methodologies and approaches utilised as well as provide an opportunity for participants to get to know each other and learn about what is happening across the community.</li>
  <br>
    <li><b>Perform activity.</b> Rippers are expected to perform some activity as part of the project. This activity could be to conduct research in their own context, incorporate research into their own practice or improve their practice. Rippers would then share their contributes back to the group remotely.</li>
  <br>
    <li><b>Attend interim workshop.</b> The workshop will give participants an opportunity to share their contributions as well as analyse results and discuss any insights from the activity. The group will then begin to form it into a complete outcome and decide next steps.</li>
  <br>
    <li><b>Capstone workshop.</b> The final workshop to pull together together any remaining work involved in the activity and form into an artefact that can be disseminated among the community through the optimal channel, such as the Computing Education Practice (CEP) or United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
  </li>
  <br>
    <li><b>Relax and unwind at a wrap-up dinner.</b> Wrap-up meal and opportunity to reflect on the experience and plan future collaborations with other rippers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>
    The focus of RIPPAs is the participants and the expectation is that <i>rippers</i> will achieve the following from participating in a RIPPA:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Strengthened knowledge and skills in research and practice.</b>
      Dependent on the specific RIPPA, the expectation is that participants will strengthen their knowledge and skills. This could be awareness emerging teaching practice and how to investigate it, appropriate methodologies for computing education research (CER) and/or deepened appreciation of the state of the art in CER.
      </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Strengthened and expanded network of collaborators.</b>
      Form connections with academics, scholars and researchers from across the computing science education community with similar interests and challenges.
      Valuable not only for conducting future research investigations but also to gain insight into innovative practice in other institutions as well as creating bonds with other academics to discuss on-going sector challenges and how to solve them.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
  <b>Publication.</b>
  The expectation is that outcomes of RIPPAs will be high-quality, multi-institutional studies that are authentic and steeped in data from contexts spanning many different from many perspectives.
  Participants will be authors on such high-quality contributions that are difficult to devise and coordinate for most sole academics.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>RIPPA 2021: Spatial Skills</h2>

  <p>This RIPPA aims to find out whether a) first-year students with better spatial skills have better programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method) and b) whether improving first-year studentsâ€™ spatial skills improves their programming skills (regardless of teaching environment or method)
  </p>

  <h4>Spatial Skills and Computer Science</h4>

  <p>Research into spatial skills and computing science has flourished in recent years, with several recent studies exploring the relationship. Spatial skills have been associated with success in computing courses and specific domains of computing (like source code navigation and expression evaluation) and training spatial skills has been demonstrated to improve CS outcomes for early-stage students. Low spatial ability also appears to be related to demographic groups with historically lower participation and outcomes in CS programmes: those from lower socio-economic status backgrounds and women. Hence spatial skills research can potentially be of high value for our discipline.
  </p>
  <p>To date these studies have involved only a handful of individual institutions. The goal of this project is to understand more about the role of spatial skills across a one-year period for entry-level CS students across multiple institutions. In particular, we would like to discover whether correlations between spatial ability and success in CS hold across institutions, whether spatial ability changes over a period of CS instruction and how spatial ability exhibits in different demographic groups.
  </p>
  <h4>Overview of Activity</h4>
  </p>
  <p>
  Participation in this project requires that you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Conduct three spatial skills tests (each lasting about half an hour) across the academic year with students in introductory computing</li>
  <li>Collect naturally occurring student data, including final course grades, course choices and demographic information</li>
  <li>Apply for ethical approval if your institution requires it (the University of Glasgow is working towards blanket approval, but and will support institutions with specific requirements)</li>
  <li>Contribute to analysis and dissemination activities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The input from students required for this study is limited: testing their spatial skills and collecting grades and demographics. Thus, the work for each participant is low, but the potential contribution of the collective work is high.
  </p>
  <p>
  There will be a drop-in information session on Mon 9th August at 15:00 BST, with the first project meeting will take place a week later. If you can't attend, contact the project lead (Jack Parkinson) for a discussion. Subsequent meetings will be at UKICER, then in December and May 2022.
