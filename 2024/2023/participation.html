                    <h2><a id="rippa">Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs)</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Research in Practice Project Activities (RIPPAs) are a new form of collaborative, community-forming activity for Computing Science education research and practice at the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aim is to bring practitioners and researchers together in computing science education to form networks, exchanges ideas, form collaborations and put research into practice, incorporate research into practice or improving practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RIPPAs span several months and participants are expected to commit to participating in a small number of workshops as well as conducting some activity in their context, such as incorporating research into practice, collecting data and/or conducting research.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Participation and Commitment</h3>
                    <p>
                        The specific participation and commitment requirements depends on the RIPPA, but broadly RIPPAS required participants to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <lI><b>Join information hour.</b> Prospective <i>rippers</i> should join one of several information hours to find out about the specific RIPPA and what it involves. Ask questions and meet others interested in the activity.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Attend start-up workshop.</b> The workshop will introduce the RIPPA, methodologies and approaches utilised as well as provide an opportunity for participants to get to know each other and learn about what is happening across
                            the community.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Perform activity.</b> Rippers are expected to perform some activity as part of the project. This activity could be to conduct research in their own context, incorporate research into their own practice or improve their practice.
                            Rippers would then share their contributes back to the group remotely.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Attend interim workshop.</b> The workshop will give participants an opportunity to share their contributions as well as analyse results and discuss any insights from the activity. The group will then begin to form it into a
                            complete outcome and decide next steps.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Capstone workshop.</b> The final workshop to pull together together any remaining work involved in the activity and form into an artefact that can be disseminated among the community through the optimal channel, such as the
                            Computing Education Practice (CEP) or United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Relax and unwind at a wrap-up dinner.</b> Wrap-up meal and opportunity to reflect on the experience and plan future collaborations with other rippers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The focus of RIPPAs is the participants and the expectation is that <i>rippers</i> will achieve the following from participating in a RIPPA:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Strengthened knowledge and skills in research and practice.</b> Dependent on the specific RIPPA, the expectation is that participants will strengthen their knowledge and skills. This could be awareness emerging teaching practice
                            and how to investigate it, appropriate methodologies for computing education research (CER) and/or deepened appreciation of the state of the art in CER.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Strengthened and expanded network of collaborators.</b> Form connections with academics, scholars and researchers from across the computing science education community with similar interests and challenges. Valuable not only
                            for conducting future research investigations but also to gain insight into innovative practice in other institutions as well as creating bonds with other academics to discuss on-going sector challenges and how to solve them.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Publication.</b> The expectation is that outcomes of RIPPAs will be high-quality, multi-institutional studies that are authentic and steeped in data from contexts spanning many different from many perspectives. Participants

                    <h2><a id="DCA">Doctoral Consortium</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        The United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference Doctoral Consortium (DC) provides an opportunity for doctoral students to engage with peers and work with researchers to reflect on the wider computing education research
                        landscape and expand it through connection and collaboration.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Aims</h3>
                    <p>The UKICER DC has the following aims:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>To allow new researchers to attend the conference, understand the UK CSEd landscape, and be introduced to the UKICER community.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>To help build a cohort group of PhD researchers who will then have a network of colleagues across the UK.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>To influence the growth of the conference, and the UKICER community, through researchers who see UKICER as a ‚Äúhome‚Äù conference.</p>
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                            <h2><a id="WiPProposals">Works in Progress (WiP) workshop</a></h2>
                                <p>The Work in Progress (WiP) workshop is a specialised event for UKICER conference attendees who are established researchers in computing education research, or hold terminal degrees (such as PhDs). The aim of the workshop is to provide a community context in which attendees give and receive friendly and constructive feedback on their work. WiP is not appropriate for PhD students, who should consider the UKICER Doctoral Consortium.
                                </p>

                                <p>A WiP workshop is an excellent opportunity to discuss and develop ongoing work. WiP submissions are concrete, anchored in a specific topic, and may be centred on various elements of work, including (but not limited to):
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>A rejected paper</li>
                                    <li>A kernel of an idea</li>
                                    <li>A grant proposal</li>
                                    <li>A research project</li>
                                    <li>A study design</li>
                                    <li>An analysis approach</li>
                                  </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p>If accepted, attendees prepare a short primer on their work (4 page maximum) circulated in advance, this supports effective discussion. Depending on the number of participants we expect to spend 30 - 45 minutes discussing the work of each attendee.</p>
