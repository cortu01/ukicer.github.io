# Organising the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference

## Overview

Acting as the General or Programme Chair for the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) is a privileged position. Privileged in that it reflects the confidence of the wider community but also empowers individuals to share and promote valuable contributions to the community and wider world.

Nevertheless, while privileged, the roles require significant commitment and the steering of various components. The following guide is designed to act as a living document that successive chairs can update and add notes. The aim is support future Chairs in shepherding and steering the conference.

### Steering Committee

The Steering Committee for UKICER comprises of former General and Programme Chairs of the conference as well as members of the community that have appropriate experience. The UKICER Steering Committee is tasked with generating a short-list of possible General Chairs and Programme Chairs as well as recommendations for the Special Interest Groups for Computing Science Education in the United Kingdom and Ireland to consider and approve.

The General Chair(s) and Programme Chair(s) are then tasked with the management and execution of the conference. This includes management of finance and budgetary concerns.

### Principles
The three principles or **Rs** of the UKICER conference are:

* **Relationships** A central aim of the conference is to connect researchers and educators across the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland (as well as beyond) interested in computing science education to disseminate knowledge, connect with one another as well as potentially collaborate. The aspiration is that the conference can sustain and support a vibrant ecosystem of computing education researchers in the UK and Ireland.

* **Research** The conference complements the United Kingdom Computing Education Practice (CEP) conference. The focus of the conference is research. The outcomes of the process as well as the process itself.

* **Rigour** The conferences aims to be the leading venue in the United Kingdom and Ireland for computing education research contributions. Consequently, such contributions should be delivered by processes that are sufficiently documented to ensure repeatability as well as reliability.



### Conference Execution and Management

There are many different components to UKICER that will require a team of individuals to manage. The General and Programme chairs will want to work together to ensure they assign an individual that is responsible for each component to ensure a smooth running conference. Chairs can use their own discretion as to how to identify and assign roles, but general advice is for the respective chairs to shortlist for the following roles and then discuss assignments.

The **General Chair** should form a short list or identify at least one individual for the following roles:

* *Web presence lead*
  - Responsibilities: Management of conference website as well as social media.


* *Audio Visual and Materials lead*
  - Responsibilities: Presentation slides, chairing of sessions via remote channels (e.g. Zoom or Microsoft Teams), audio or video recording of sessions, promotional videos for social media, management of any audience response systems (e.g. Mentimeter).
  - Not all responsibilities are applicable for every conference, it will vary from year to year. The role typically suits a technical-minded research student as they are able to connect and talk with various members of the community while also supporting them to deliver high-quality presentations.


* *Engagement lead*
  - Responsibilities: Travel arrangement for invited speakers (e.g. Keynote speaker), travel arrangement for Programme Chair (e.g. from airport to conference location), conference dinner, social activities, social guide (e.g. interesting activities and local locations to visit), hotel recommendations, budget elements and travel information.
  - Not all responsibilities are applicable for every conference, it will vary from year to year. The role typically suits an academic member of staff or administration staff.


* *Registration lead*
  - Responsibilities: Registration rates and arrangements at site, including handling processing contracts, on-site registration desks as well as managing refunds. The registration led also produces the attendee list (seeking consent from delegates), collecting information from delegates such as any specific requirements from delegates such as dietary and accessibility, collecting information regarding attendance at any workshops.


* *Local Organising Committee*
  - Responsibilities: Managing signage at event, coordinating with on-site staff (e.g. security officers, catering etc), managing desks and help-points as well as providing guidance to delegates.
  - The expectation is that a reasonable local organising committee would comprise around six members with a leader that is easily identifiable by delegates as to ensure that chairs are not overwhelmed with requests.

The **Programme Chair(s)** should form a short list or identify at least one individual for the following roles:

* *Proxy Chair*
  - Responsibilities: assembling an appropriate proxy committee to review submissions that represent a Conflict of Interest (CoI) with those involved in the execution of the conference, delegation and management of CoI associated with the conference, compiling recommendations and reviews of the proxy panel, review of general CoI policy in advance of call for participation and communication of recommendations to Programme Chair(s).
  - The Proxy Chair is a significant responsibility and requires an established member of the community that is able to assemble a proxy committee that is able to effectively review CoI submissions for those where the conflict is with those that execute the conference.


* *Poster Chair(s)*
  - Responsibilities: managing the call for participation for posters, coordinating with the programme chair in terms of timeline for submissions, assembling a reasonable commitment to review submissions, notifying authors of accepted submissions, manage submissions and dissemination arrangements.
  - The expectation of the roles varies with the prominence of posters at the conference. If the expectation is that posters will be published then the Poster Chair(s) in consultation with the Programme Chair(s) will want to make sure that all requirements of the publisher are being met, specifically in terms of the review and dissemination process. The Poster Chair will have to assemble a programme committee to review posters or at minimum at least form a panel that review all poster submissions, e.g. two Poster Chair(s) that review and decide the outcome for each submission.
  - The Poster Chair(s) will also want to coordinate with the registration lead as well to determine what attendees are attending what workshop as well as coordinate with the General Chair and Local Organising Committee in terms of organising the session at the conference. There may be several poster sessions scheduled as extended breaks with catering that will require coordination.


* *Workshops Chair(s)*
  - Responsibilities: managing the call for participation for workshops, coordinating with the programme chair in terms of timeline for submissions, assembling a reasonable commitment to review submissions, notifying authors of accepted workshops, manage submissions and dissemination arrangements, coordination and execution of workshops at conference, budgets and catering.
  - The expectation of the role varies with the prominence of workshops at the conference. If the expectation is that workshops will be published then the Workshop Chair(s) in consultation with the Programme Chair(s) will want to make sure all the requirements of the publisher are being met, specifically in terms of the review and dissemination process. The Workshop Chair will have to assemble a programme committee to review proposals or at minimum at least form a panel that reviews all workshop proposals, e.g. two Workshop Chair(s) that review and decide the outcome for each workshop proposal.
  - The Workshop Chair(s) will need to collect information from workshop organisers in terms of expected requirements and work with the Audio Visual and Materials lead to ensure they can support the organisers in successfully executing their workshop. The Workshop Chair(s) will also need to work with the General Chair and Programme Chair in terms of anticipating the popularity and space requirements for different workshops and how to support workshop delegates in participating in them.
  - The Workshop Chair(s) will also want to follow-up with organising and delegates to determine the success of the workshop as to report any outcomes and to inform selection of workshops at future iterations of the conference.


* *Dissemination Chair(s)*
  - Responsibilities: management of the peer-review system (e.g. EasyChair), management of any publication systems (e.g. TAPS), coordinating with publishers, management of intellectual property concerns, handling dissemination queries (e.g. open access queries, formatting etc).
  - The expectation of the role varies depends on the review and publishing system that is selected. The role generally requires individuals to chase-up authors in terms of submitting final camera-ready versions of any articles, handling any incomplete intellectual property concerns (e.g. copyright forms, open access queries) as well as third-party materials. The role also requires coordination with the publisher (e.g. ACM).


* *Keynote speaker*

### Programme Committee

The Programme Chair(s) are responsible for assembling an appropriate committee that can review submissions from the community.

The scale of the commitment depends on the anticipated number of submissions, expertise required, the timelines and commitment involved as well as any additional requirements, such as what the publisher expects of the review process.

The expectation is that PCs should plan for around a minimum of three reviews for each submission and expect at minimum of around 30 submissions for the paper track. Consequently, the PCs will need to acquire at least 90 reviews from the committee. A 30-person committee with a generous timeline would result in each member handling three reviews.

It is worthwhile to consider the anticipated number of members that will have to serve on the commitment and what sort expertise you might need to ensure submissions are properly reviewed.

#### Recruitment

There is an established and committed Programme Committee already for the conference and PCs should be able to continue to rely on members from previous years to serve on their conference. It will not be the case that every member that has served on the programme committee previously for the conference can commit each year.

For recruitment of new members, it is worthwhile to consider previously published authors that have not served on the commitment previously and ask them to participate. It is worthwhile to remind them that guidance and support is provided, in the instance where they may not have completed much reviewing previously.

Another avenue for possible appropriate committee members would be to consider the programme committee for other relevant venues, such as the International Computing Education Conference and ACM Transactions on Computing Education.
