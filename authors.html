                    <h3>Process for Papers and Posters</h3>
                    <p>
                        The review process for papers and posters is double-blind with authors required to submit anonymised artefacts. Each submission is reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee. Upon completion of reviews, reviewers enter the discussion
                        stage and are expected to discuss their reviews anonymously, especially when notable differences exist. The programme chair utilises discussions and reviews to determine an appropriate balance of accepted papers.

                        Authors must ensure their submissions abide by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">ACM Conflict of Interest Policy (COI)</a>. Reviewers are required by chairs to identify any conflicts of
                        interest prior to being allocated any submissions to review. Authors are expected to inform any conflicts of interest prior or at the point of submission of any artefacts for review.

                    <p>
                        Submissions that represent a conflict of interest for all conference chairs are passed to the proxy chair. The proxy chair assembles an expert panel of two or more members, the members are not required to be part of the programme committee. The members
                        of the expert panel are not known to the chairs. The proxy chair and expert panel consider the conflicted papers, reviews and any discussion amongst reviewers. The expert panel makes the final decision on the conflicted papers
                        and this is communicated to the conference chairs.
